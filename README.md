> **Abstract:** *Image deblurring is a very challenging task due to the various obscuration factors in the real world. While the supervised deep learning approach showed great power in solving image deblurring problems,the models required a lot of labeled data, which were difficult to collect.
        This paper presents a novel approach that utilized pretrained large diffusion models to generate potential image features, which enhanced the training process and generalization performance.
        The pretrained diffusion model first generated synthetic image features through learning the potential distribution of the data.
        These synthetic image features were used together with the existing real data for model training to expand the
        training set and improve the generalization ability of the model.
        The proposed deblurring model was termed as Sliding window restoration transformer (Swintormer).
        Experiments on mainstream testing datasets showed that the new method achieved the state-of-the-art performance
        and had a significant advantage in the computational efficiency.
        Extensive ablation studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of each network module to the final
        performance.*
